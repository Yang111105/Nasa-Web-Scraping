# web-scraping-challenge

This exercise builds a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

The following outlines were performed:

1. Scraping: NASA Mars News, JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image, Mars Facts, Mars Hemispheres
2. MongoDB and Flask Application: Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above

How to run the codes:
1. Open Jupyter notebook "mission_to_mars" and run the codes for data scraping
2. Run app.py in Git Bash and open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in the browser, click Scrape New Data. First time opening this web there is a blank page with only headlines, however clicking Scrape bottom will pop the content.

#### ** Note that sometimes the site shows as broken with "can't be reached" or other error messages while reloading, but the content shows up automatically once the code complete running
